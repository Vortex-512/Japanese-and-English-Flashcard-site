# Japanese-and-English-Flashcard-site
This is a downloadable website that'll help you memorize Japanese Kanji / Romaji. Its most comparable to something like Quizlet.

In order to run this website, simply download the zip file provided called: "Learn_Japanese.zip", extract it and run the "index.html" file.
You can choose to either use your mouse or keyboard to navigate the website. Keys like the arrow keys, space, enter and the number keys let you select tings more efficiently.
All the data for the word lists is taken from this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/japanese/comments/g87bn7/top_1000_japanese_words_kanji_romaji_english/
The lists exist as variables in the "libraryScript.js" file.
If you find any bugs, please reach out to me.
